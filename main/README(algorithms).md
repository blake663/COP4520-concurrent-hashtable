## Compiling the Code
First compile the code in the command line as follows:
```
java HashTable.java LockingHashTable.java
```
This will compile the the files, creating HashTable.class and LockingHashTable.class in the working directory.
Since there is no main function in any of these program, there is nothing to run.
